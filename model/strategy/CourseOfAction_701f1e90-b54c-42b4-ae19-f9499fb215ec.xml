    documentation="The central idea of the secured chain approach “is to create a secured flow of&#xA;information from the capture of business transactions to the final determination&#xA;of the correct amount of tax being paid. Tax compliance requirements are in&#xA;this way built into the technology systems and processes used by the taxpayer&#xA;anyway for the purpose of managing the business. The systems in this scenario&#xA;are purposely designed to make it impossible or difficult to manipulate or erase&#xA;information (or make such attempts easy to detect). The different participants&#xA;that support the taxpayer (e.g. tax advisors or accountants) are subject to quality&#xA;standards and quality assurance checks or certification schemes”."/>
