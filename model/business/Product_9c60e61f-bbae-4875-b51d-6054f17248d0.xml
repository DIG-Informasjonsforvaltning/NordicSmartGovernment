    documentation="One way that PSD2 opens up for non-banks is through open APIs. By using banksâ€™ APIs non-banks can enter the financial market without the heavy compliance and infrastructure which banks are required to maintain. This opens up the financial market to new entrants with fresh ideas about how to shape the banking experience. Some banks have already started making their APIs available. Examples hereof are the Danish Saxo Bank, that opened up for their APIs in September 201510  and Capital One, a UK based bank, that already now enables affiliates to benefit through their APIs."/>
