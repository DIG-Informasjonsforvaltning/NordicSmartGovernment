    documentation="In suppliers Purchase Systems, orders are originally delivered to see the payables (money owed by a business to its suppliers), and follow the payables to make the payments. &#xA;&#xA;Give a chance to the bookkeeping account number. We do not use the raw data from the invoices. Systems was created before e-invoices. The row information was not added. When e-invoices came later, they were not able to input the rot w data. We are in a situation that we have the information in einvoices, but we do not have a system that can eat invoices. EPRs are very closed... it cannot read the raw information. We have to show what you can do if you have that information there. Estonia have build their system later. I want to see the invoice row informaiton. It is here.... In finland, could you hide it - because we don't use it.... &#xA;&#xA;It would be easier to start with e-order. If I get an xml details in the order I can use it. The fastest way to get purchase information into database. Products and providers are there. I&#xA;&#xA;For the seller. "/>
